> ### 5.1 Logging Requirements
> ```yaml
> Adaptive Logging:
>   Priority 1 (Always Log):
>     - Security-critical operations
>     - Resource-intensive tasks
>     - System modifications
>     
>   Priority 2 (Sample Logging):
>     - Routine operations
>     - Standard resource usage
>     - Regular system calls
>     
>   Priority 3 (Debug Only):
>     - Development operations
>     - Test executions
>     - Local builds
> ```
> 
> ### 5.2 Audit Mechanisms
> ```yaml
> Smart Auditing:
>   Continuous:
>     - Critical security scans
>     - Essential dependency checks
>     
>   Periodic:
>     - Non-critical security reviews
>     - Performance analysis
>     
>   On-Demand:
>     - Detailed system audits
>     - Custom security checks
> ```
> 
> ### 6.1 Integration Protocol
> ```yaml
> Balanced Integration:
>   Command Handling:
>     allow:
>       - Essential development operations
>       - Core build processes
>       - Standard deployments
>     monitor:
>       - Resource-intensive operations
>       - Network activities
>       - System modifications
>     
>   IDE Integration:
>     unrestricted:
>       - Local development
>       - Testing
>       - Debugging
>     controlled:
>       - Remote execution
>       - Production deployments
> ```
> 
> ### 6.2 Maintenance Protocol
> ```yaml
> Adaptive Maintenance:
>   Regular Reviews:
>     - Performance impact assessment
>     - Security vs. functionality balance
>     - User experience feedback
>     
>   Policy Updates:
>     - Focus on high-risk areas
>     - Maintain development velocity
>     - Preserve agent capabilities
> ```
> 
> ### 7.1 Violation Handling
> ```yaml
> Smart Response:
>   High Risk:
>     - Immediate action required
>     - Full logging and analysis
>     - Security team notification
>     
>   Medium Risk:
>     - Warning and monitoring
>     - Logged for review
>     - Potential adjustments
>     
>   Low Risk:
>     - Monitor and log
>     - Periodic review
>     - Update policies if pattern emerges
> ```
> 
> ### 7.2 Recovery Procedures
> ```yaml
> Balanced Recovery:
>   Critical:
>     - Immediate restoration
>     - Full security review
>     - Policy adjustment
>     
>   Non-Critical:
>     - Scheduled maintenance
>     - Regular updates
>     - Optimization
> ```
> 
> This revised approach:
> 1. Maintains core functionality while implementing security measures
> 2. Uses monitoring instead of blocking for most operations
> 3. Implements graduated responses based on risk levels
> 4. Preserves development velocity
> 5. Focuses on logging and analysis rather than restrictions
> 6. Allows for dynamic adjustment based on actual usage patterns
> 7. Emphasizes balance between security and functionality
> 
> The key is to monitor and understand patterns rather than implement strict
> blocks, allowing the agent to operate effectively while maintaining security
> awareness.
